# Random Password Generator

This program generates a random password from 8 to 128 chracters that can also be coppied to the computers clipboard. This is important to me because the automatically generated passwords in browser are not shared between my devices nor are they able to be coppied to a clipboard or written down for ease of use. This program allows useres to create strong passwords capeable of meeting any user's password needs, and copy said password to any destination the user chooses. 


### Usage

To create a new passsword click the "Generate Password" button. Next, input a value of at least 8 and no more than 128 when prompted. Select the types of characters needed for the password when asked. The new password should be visible on the webpage. This passowrd can be coppied to the clipboard by clicking on the "Copy Password" button. The new passowrd can now be implemented whever the user sees fit.
